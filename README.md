4) Approach a source of cobblestone
5) Execute script.exe
6) A 10 second timer will begin. Tab back to your game during this time period
7) The script will run until all pickaxes are disposed of, or until the user terminates the program. 
NOTE: The program can be terminateed by swiftly moving the cursor to any of the 4 corners of the screen, or by pressing CTRL+C in terminal. 

Program is compiled to run in Windows, but can be built on Linux or MacOS. A package requirements file is included for those who would like to compile the script themselves.
